Beneath each sentence there are four options marked A, B, C and D. Choose the one that best completes the sentence or answers the question. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.","questions":[{"order":11,"question":"If we a bused by the power of the social rule, we must take steps to defuse its energy.","options":["A. were not to be","B. are not to be","C. should not be","D. would not be"],"answer":"B","analysis":"不定式题。“be+不定式”可以表示计划、打算。本题中增加难度的部分是不定式又使用了被动语态,形成了 to be done 结构的不定式,且为否定形式,与 be 合起来变成了 be not to be done 结构。又因为从句主语是 we,主句用一般现在时,所以 be动词应该为 are,故 B 为答案。由句意判断,不需要使用虚拟语气,因此排除 A; should 表示应该,与句意不符,排除 C; would 更多地表示意愿或情绪,与句意不符,故排除 D。"},{"order":12,"question":"A team of engineers has been developing a space clean up satellite to eliminate man-made orbital debris, broken-down satellites or tossed-away rocket stages.","options":["A. be it","B. if it is","C. whether it is","D. no matter"],"answer":"A","analysis":"省略倒装题。本题逗号后是一个省略了句子成分的让步状语从句,补充完整后应为 ...whether it might be broken-down satellites or tossed-away rocket stages。让步状语有条件的意味,通常使用虚拟语气。如果省略引导词 whether,则从句应用倒装结构,其中 might 可以省略,故 A 为答案。if 引导让步状语从句时,不能与 or 连用,排除 B；将whether it is 填入空格从字面意思上来看没有大问题,但这样表达更口语化,并不是特别规范,排除 C；no matter 引导状语从句时,通常与 what , who , when , where , which , how 等疑问词连用,而且需要搭配主语、谓语、或表语,单独的 no matter 无法使句子完整,排除 D。"},{"order":13,"question":"Meiling returned from abroad a totally different person. The italicized part functions as a(n) in the sentence.","options":["A. Appositive","B. object","C. adverbial","D. complement"],"answer":"D","analysis":"句子成分题。本句中,a totally different person 描述了美玲从国外回来时的状态,是对主语“美玲”的补充说明。因此,句中斜体部分是主语补足语,故D为答案。要解答本题,除了要判断出斜体部分的语法功能外,还需要知 appositive “同位语”、object “宾语”、adverbial “状语”和 complement“补语”这几个词在英语语法领域中的意思。"},{"order":14,"question":"Welcome to this special edition of TV Picks, featuring things that must be read to be consumed, let alone:books.","options":["A. being understood","B. to understand","C. understood","D. understand"],"answer":"C","analysis":"句子结构题。let alone 后面可以跟动词原形、动词不定式、动名词、名词等,后面具体应该跟什么样的形式,取决于其前面所对比内容的形式,要与其前面的结构保持一致。本题中,let alone 后面的部分与其前面的 to be consumed 是并列关系。因此,应填入与 to be consumed 同样结构的 to be understood, 其中相同的成分 to be 可省略,故 C 为答案。"},{"order":15,"question":"When you have finished with that novel, don't forget to return it to Tom,____?","options":["A. will you","B. do you","C. don't you","D. won't you"],"answer":"A","analysis":"反意疑问句。本题开头是 When 引导的时间状语从句,句子主干 don`t forget to return it to Tom 是祈使句。当祈使句为否定形式时,后面的反意疑问句部分只能用肯定形式 will you,故 A 为答案。"},{"order":16,"question":"Cities have nonprofit associations, usually made up of Fire Department personnel working on their own time to provide inspections.","options":["A. fire-safety home free","B. home free fire-safety","C. fire-safety fre ehome","D. free home fire-safety"],"answer":"D","analysis":"修饰顺序题。空格后是名词 inspections,而 fire-safety inspection 是比较常见的搭配,表示“消防安全检查”。home 后应紧跟 fire-safety inspections, home 用下雨限定消防安全检查的区域,即仅限于家庭范围内。free 可以对家庭消防安全检查的性质进行界定,即“免费的”。故 D 为答案。"},{"order":17,"question":"There is no means a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.","options":["A. Where","B. to which","C. when","D. that"],"answer":"B","analysis":"定语从句题。分析句子结构可知,本句是一个含有定语从句的主从复合句。先行词是means,空格所填词及其后部分构成一个定于从句,修饰先行词 means。resort to 为固定搭配,意味“借助,使用”,resort to...means 意为“借助某种方法”。因此,需要在 which 前面额外加上介词 to,与resort 搭配使用。故 B 为答案。需要注意的是,句子中本来就存在一个 to,但这个 to 与它后面的动词原形 avoid搭配使用,构成的是不定式形式。"},{"order":18,"question":"PersonA: Where is Tim ?  PersonB: He might be next door.  What is the function of the modal auxiliary verb “might” in the reply ?","options":["A. To express relief.","B. To dramatize a fact.","C. To indicate possibility.","D. To ask for permission."],"answer":"A","analysis":"情态动词题。might 一词可以用作推测,表示可能性。再结合句意可知,在回答 A 的问题, B 的答复存在不确定性。因此,might 在答句中所表示的是具有某种可能性。故 C 为答案。"},{"order":19,"question":" “After a confused silence, the speaker attempted a weak reply only to halt midway to confer with his assistant and finally to admit that he had made a mistake.” The two infinitive phrases after“midway” are used to ____.","options":["A. show purpose","B. indicate result","C. indicate manner","D. predict consequence"],"answer":"A","analysis":"不定式用法题。动词不定式作状语时,可以用来表示动作的目的结果、原因、条件和方式。结合句子意思可知,“中途停下”是为了可以“与助手商议”,而商议的结果是“承认他犯了一个错误”。综合来看, midway 之后的两个不定式表达的是“中途停下”的目的。故 A 为答案。"},{"order":20,"question":"Which of the following italicized phrases is INCORRECT?","options":["A. The town is now ten times its original size.","B. The seller asked for double the usual price.","C. I wish I had two times his strength.","D. They come here four times every year."],"answer":"C","analysis":"倍数表达题。“两倍”的正确表达是 double 或 twice。例如：① The church has doubled its membership in the last five years.（这座教堂的会众在过去的五年里增加了一倍。）② Interest rates are twice as high as those of our competitors.（利率是我们竞争对手的两倍高。）表达“两倍”的概念不用 two times,只有表达三倍及以上的倍数概念时,才用“数词 + times”结构。因此,C 为答案。该句的正确表述是“I wish I had tiwce his strength”。"},{"order":21,"question":"The program includes an of program options for ESL/EFL teachers.","options":["A. Array","B. arrangement","C. agreement","D. assortment"],"answer":"D","analysis":"名词辨析题。assortment 表示“各式各样”,英文解释为 a collection containing a variety of sorts of things,常用搭配是“an assortment of +可数名词复数”,表示“各种各样的东西”。填入空格处表示“各种各样的课程”,符合语境,故 D 为答案。array 具有强干扰性, an array of... 表示“大量…”,而题干强调的是“课程选择的多样性”,而不是“课程选择的数量大”,故可排除 A。arrangement 意为“安排”,agreement 意为“协议”,均不符合句意,可排除。"},{"order":22,"question":"The volcano on Friday, opening up an 800-meter-long crack in its crater.","options":["A. Ejected","B. erupted","C. spewed","D. ignited"],"answer":"B","analysis":"动词辨析题。分析句子结构可知,主语volcano 之后应搭配一个不及物动词,表示火山“喷发”。选项中只有 erupted 最合适,故 B 为答案。ejected 意为“弹出”,ignited 意为“点燃”,明显不合语境,可排除。spewed 一词也可以表示火山喷发,但它通常与 from 搭配,表示某些物质大量喷发出来,可排除。"},{"order":23,"question":"As previously suspected, the inhabitants of the region had been hunter-gatherers living relatively lifestyles.","options":["A. Separated","B. remote","C. lonely","D. solitary"],"answer":"D","analysis":"形容词辨析题。solitary 一词表示“独自的,单独的”,常与 life 或 lifestyle 搭配,故 D 为答案。separated 意为“（和某人）分居的”,remote 意为“遥远的”,lonely 意为“孤独的”,这三项均不符合语境,故可排除。"},{"order":24,"question":"The governor posted as tatement online saying he “misspoke” and tried to his comments.","options":["A. Cleanse","B. clear","C. clarify","D. clean"],"answer":"C","analysis":"动词辨析题。由句意可知,州长承认自己之前的话语是有问题的,那么他需要做的是再给出一个准确的声明。备选项中能够表示将话语进行“澄清”的只有 clarify,故 C 为答案。 cleanse意为“清洁(皮肤),清晰（伤口）”,clear 意为“搬走,清除”,clean “除去灰尘,打扫”, 这三项不符合语境,可排除。"},{"order":25,"question":"The country is making progress on its bailout reform commitments but bad bank loans could a fledgling recovery.","options":["A. divert","B. derail","C. distract","D. deconstruct"],"answer":"B","analysis":"动词辨析题。根据常识可知,recovery“复苏”是一种进程,因此空格处填入 derail “破坏,干扰（计划、协议等）”,表示这种进程可能会因为银行的不良贷款而受到干扰,故 B 为答案。divert 意为“转移；改变用途”,distract 意为“使分心,分散（注意力）”,deconstruct 意为“解构”,均不符合语境,可排除。"},{"order":26,"question":".The parents almost collapsed upon learning that their child had been diagnosed a rare disease.","options":["A. with","B. as","C. for","D. over"],"answer":"A","analysis":"固定搭配题。该题考查diagnose 与介词的搭配。dignose sb. with sth 意为“诊断出某人患有某种疾病”。故 A 为答案。"},{"order":27,"question":"Major airlines have banned the transport of hunting trophies from Africa in the of the outrage over the shooting death of a lion in Zimbabwe.","options":["A. call","B. midst","C. result","D. wake"],"answer":"D","analysis":"固定搭配题。in the wake of... 意为“随着...而来,作为...的结果”,经常放在句中,表示某种因果关联。短语后的内容是“因”,短语前的内容是“果”。本题干中,津巴布韦的一头狮子被射杀是“因”,各大航空公司的禁运令是“果”。故D为答案。"},{"order":28,"question":"The cited study suggested that parental involvement in homework can boost a student's academic performance.","options":["A. Widely","B. likely","C. popularly","D. eventually"],"answer":"A","analysis":"副词辨析题。空格所在位置的副词用来修饰 cited。根据句意和备选项判断,研究是被“广泛地”引用,故 A 为答案。likely 意为“可能地” eventually 意为“最后,终于”,均不符合语境,可排除。popularly 具有强干扰性,因为该词也有“普遍地,广泛地”这一意思,但它强调的是在民众中的受欢迎程度,不适合此处语境,故也可排除。"},{"order":29,"question":"Salespeople here are paid on a commission basis; however,continued employment is based on their ability to sell service contracts rather than","options":["A. Commodity","B. product","C. produce","D. merchandise"],"answer":"D","analysis":"名词辨析题。选项中四个词都有“产品”的意思,本题考查的是这四个词意思的细微差异。commodity “商品”通常强调可买卖的产品或原材料,较常用作国家间的贸易商品; product “产品”一般是指通过制造或种植所产出的产品；produce“更多地指农产品”；merchandise “商品”指用于买卖的货物,也可以用作特定商品,如奥运会的指定商品。在本题干中,空格所填词与service“服务”相对,选择 merchandise 最符合语境。故 D 为答案。"},{"order":30,"question":"Anthropologists were intrigued to learn that Kennewick Man was different from today's native Americans.","options":["A.
